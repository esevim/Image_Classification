# Classifying Images using CNN architecture with Tensorflow

 - Application:
We see different implementations of Image classification  in our daily life around us, like health, security etc.
CNN model is used on this model to get the vest performance, loss and predictions.

 - Database:
[10 Monkey Species Dataset from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/slothkong/10-monkey-species)
The dataset consists of two files, training and validation. Each folder contains 10 subforders labeled as n0~n9, each corresponding a species form Wikipedia's monkey cladogram. Images are 400x300 px or larger and JPEG format (almost 1400 images).


Evaluate the model, how?
How your model change when you have a deeper model or change number of nodes (try optimizing your model architecture)?
The best performance (i.e what are the model hyperparameters or structure that you will get the best performance, or most optimized model)
